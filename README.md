# AI-Introduction
This repository is for a [Artificial Intelligence introduction course][ai_intro] at IT-HÃ¶gskolan.

In this repository there is a PowerPoint presentation about self-driving cars were I was part of a group that looked into this subject on a surface level.

There is also a report on how a AI-project workflow with the linear regression machine learning algorithm could look like theoretically.
